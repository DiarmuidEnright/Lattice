## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ with Cargo
- PostgreSQL 14+ and Redis 7+ (a `docker-compose.yml` is provided to run both locally)
- Python 3 (used to serve the static frontend)

### 1. Configure environment

Copy the example environment file and fill in real values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and provide your own credentials. The backend loads configuration
exclusively from the environment and **fails fast on startup**, naming every
missing required credential, if any are absent. At minimum you must set
`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, the Solana RPC settings (`SOLANA_RPC_URL`,
`SOLANA_RPC_FALLBACK_URL`, `SOLANA_NETWORK`), the Claude settings
(`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_MODEL`), the Stripe settings (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID`), and
`JWT_SECRET`. The committed `.env.example` contains only non-functional
placeholder values.

### 2. Start dependencies

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

### 3. Build

```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

For an optimized binary used to run the backend:

```bash
cargo build --workspace --release
```

### 4. Run the backend

After a release build, start the API server (listens on port 3000):

```bash
./target/release/api
```

The backend requires the `.env` configuration plus PostgreSQL and Redis to be
reachable. If port 3000 is already in use, it reports a distinct
port-unavailable condition.

### 5. Serve the frontend

From the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. The frontend talks to the
backend at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### 6. Run the tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```
